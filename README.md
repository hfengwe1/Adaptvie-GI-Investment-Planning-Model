# Adaptvie-GI-Investment-Planning-Model
Our adaptive GI investment planning model is an extension of the basic method proposed by Hung and Hobbs (2019). The basic approach accounts for the following characteristics of the GI decision framework:
•	optimization of stormwater reduction over multiple years subject to monetary budget limita-tions and the acceptable risk level specified by users; 
•	uncertainty in SMP performance and cost that changes from one investment decision stage to the next as a result of learning and investment; and 
•	adaptive investment planning framework, including multiple investment decision stages (e.g., years 0 and 5) and consideration of the value of learning for improving decisions in later stages.
The method is structured as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse, in which uncertainties
