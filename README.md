# Adaptvie-GI-Investment-Planning-Model
Our adaptive GI investment planning model is an extension of the basic method proposed by Hung and Hobbs (2019). The basic approach accounts for the following characteristics of the GI decision framework:
•	optimization of stormwater reduction over multiple years subject to monetary budget limita-tions and the acceptable risk level specified by users; 
•	uncertainty in SMP performance and cost that changes from one investment decision stage to the next as a result of learning and investment; and 
•	adaptive investment planning framework, including multiple investment decision stages (e.g., years 0 and 5) and consideration of the value of learning for improving decisions in later stages.
The method is structured as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse, in which uncertainties are characterized by discrete scenarios with probabilities.  The uncertain coefficients are the SMP cost-effectiveness, which follow some distributions representing the current understanding of the SMPs cost-effectiveness. Based on the learning assumptions, the distribution parameters would be updated if the first-stage investments exceed the learning thresholds. For example, the multi-stage learning model with technology improvement assumes that, if learning criteria are met, the mean values of the cost-effectiveness distributions will increase by γ%, and the standard deviation would be reduced by β%. Our GI investment planning model is developed based on this variant.
